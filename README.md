## Activity: Editing and merging via a branch and a pull request

Open up the `pie.py` file in the code editor in the GitHub browser: 
1. Right click on the file name to open the file in a new tab, so you can still read these instructions.
2. Then click the pencil icon to edit the file.

Edit the file:
1. Read through the code and ask yourself: What does this code do? What will the outputs be?
2. Create a new `Pie` object that contains a different kind of pie.

Once you've made these changes, click **"Commit changes..."** and select **"Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."** Follow the directions to commit your changes.

What happens next? 

- If you are able to merge your changes, go ahead and do so.

- If you are _not_ able to merge your changes... why is this happening? What might you do to be able to manage any merge conflicts that arise?

_Write your notes about what happened below (along with your name), by editing this README.md file._

1. This code creates a pie object in Python, which is defined as a tuple with different fields for defining the name of a type of pie, the filling, and what the crust of the pie is made of.

I was able to merge the changes.
